# PostSuggestion

This project consists of creating a class for creating, updating and translating posts for social networks. The client can insert the characteristics of the product, service or event that will be the subject of their post and define some parameters such as number of characters, amount of emojis, language and others. After its creation, the post can be updated to make adjustments, in addition to being translated into other languages.
